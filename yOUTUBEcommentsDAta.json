And nobody that&#39;s within the to 20%-40% want to or would even attempt to work those jobs when they did quit. Not when they are the ones making at least 80% or more of the money... it&#39;s not balanced, and the rich wouldn&#39;t want it to be balanced... they feel they are worth more cause they used their head more and earned it. It&#39;s not true at all. If all the bottom 20%-40% just banded together one day and decided we&#39;re going to let the top 60%-80% fend for themselves, then the top 60%-80% wouldn&#39;t have no food water power electricity etc... cause all of the employees would have quit work. At least up to the point that nobody who knows how to do the work that keeps everyone alive is still working or helping the rest out... what would they do then... if they tried to force us that are in poverty to get back to work, they would have a fight on their hands that they couldn&#39;t win... and there are studies out there proving that just book knowledge isn&#39;t enough to get by when it comes to doing the jobs. So they would be screwed. Very few would survive being that they got lucky, and that&#39;s not saying they would survive long. Just survive. Not thrive. Just barely scrape by... just wait another generation, maybe 2. If it continues like it is going, then that&#39;s probably going to be exactly what happens.... not to come across with a negative outlook but speaking with truth cause I&#39;ve been hearing it my whole life growing up. But the upper-class and upper middle class haven&#39;t because most of them didn&#39;t start in poverty, and poverty then was the same as poverty now... I wonder if we got another Boston ☕️ party situation coming soon... if there is something we ought to know, it&#39;s better to confess it instead of having someone else blow the whistle on it all... at least then, there is a chance of fixing mistakes and making amendments. However, if there is something being hidden and those that are hidden from finding out about it or when they say enough is enough, then it&#39;s most likely too late... that&#39;s all just hypothetical, of course. Hopefully, things get solved. For the greater good of all. Funny that I&#39;ve only ever heard for the greater good when it comes to war and genocide ot things like that. But the only time it would actually be for the greater good of all would be now and times like now whenever there&#39;s imbalances that tip the scale of equality too much. 😉 something to think on. I&#39;ve been working slowly at articulating some big thoughts on the infrastructure &amp; structure of government and uniting everybody, but I have more work to do.🎉😊 have a good day",
